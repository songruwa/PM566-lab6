## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Download the data
```{r,cache=TRUE}
fn<-"mtsamples.csv"
if (!file.exists(fn))
  download.file("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/USCbiostats/data-science-data/master/00_mtsamples/mtsamples.csv.",destfile = fn)

mtsamples<-read.csv(fn)
mtsamples<-as_tibble(mtsamples)
head(mtsamples)
```



Question 1: What specialties do we have?
We can use count() from dplyr to figure out how many different catagories do we have? Are these catagories related? overlapping? evenly distributed?
```{r,cache=TRUE}
specialties<-
  mtsamples %>%
  count(medical_specialty)

specialties%>%
  arrange(desc(n)) %>%
  top_n(n,15)%>%
  knitr::kable()


```

There are 'r nrow(specialties)' specialties.

```{r dist,cache=TRUE}
ggplot(mtsamples,aes(x=medical_specialty))+
  geom_histogram(stat="count")+
  coord_flip()


```

These aren't evenly distributed.


Question 2
Tokenize the the words in the transcription column
Count the number of times each token appears
Visualize the top 20 most frequent words
Explain what we see from this result. Does it makes sense? What insights (if any) do we get?
```{r,cache=TRUE}
library(forcats)
mtsamples %>%
  unnest_tokens(output=word,input = transcription)%>%
  count(word,sort=TRUE)%>%
  top_n(20)%>%
  ggplot(aes(x=n,y=fct_reorder(word,n)))+
  geom_col()
```

I found the word "patient" is   important, and there are many stop words


Question 3
Redo visualization but remove stopwords before
Bonus points if you remove numbers as well
What do we see know that we have removed stop words? Does it give us a better idea of what the text is about?
```{r,cache=TRUE}
library(forcats)
mtsamples %>%
  unnest_tokens(output=word,input = transcription)%>%
  count(word,sort=TRUE)%>%
  top_n(20)%>%
  ggplot(aes(x=n,y=fct_reorder(word,n)))+
  geom_col()
```

Looking better, but we don't like the numbers.
